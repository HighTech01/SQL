--For this project I used Spotify data I downloaded from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL

--Creating the table

CREATE TABLE Spotify_data (
track_uri PRIMARY KEY,
track varchar NOT NULL,
artist varchar NOT NULL,
artist_popularity integer NOT NULL,
followers integer NOT NULL,
artist_genre varchar NOT NULL,
track_popularity integer NOT NULL,
album varchar NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,1) NOT NULL,
energy float NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(4,1) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness float NOT NULL,
tempo float NOT NULL
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data.csv into the table.

--Next I explored the data using the following SQL

--First I determined the avg popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track.
SELECT
artist,
track,
avg(popularity),
avg(danceability),
avg(energy)
FROM Spotify_data
GROUP BY artist, track;

--Then I found who the top 10 artists are based on popularity
SELECT track, artist, track_popularity
FROM Spotify_data
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
